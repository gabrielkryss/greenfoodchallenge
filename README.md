The user can alternate between two pie charts by swiping right or left. The blue pie chart indicates the percentage of each portion in the user's diet. The red pie chart indicates how much each portion contributes to the production of CO2e.


On pressing the edit icon, the user may change the name of their plan if they wish.





 
The user is also given information about approximately how many metric tonnes of CO2e are created from the current food plan, and the equalancy of how many kilometers an average car could drive to produce that amount.
The user's current plan is also displayed. 

## Improve Plan Activity
This activity is reached by pressing the 'Improve' button seen in the dashboard. Here, a new plan is displayed for the user. This plan is generated by an algorithm that seeks to reduce the user's CO2e by 10%. To do this, it uses a scaling factor to slightly adjust each of the user's food portions, starting with those which produce the most CO2e.
A toast will be generated to inform the user how much CO2e could be reduced if all of Metro Vancouver were to use the same plan.

If the user wishes to edit the plan, the edit button will reveal sliders and update the amount of CO2e saved in real time. If the plan produces a greater amount of CO2e than the previous plan, the pie graph will turn red as a warning indication.
